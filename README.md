Description:
On button click "new sprite":
- A sort of creature gets randomly created as a tree of cells.
- A sprite is calculated to match the structures definition.

On button click "evolve":
- The most recently created cell tree structure gets altered 100 times, resembling a sort of mutation.
- The sprite is adjusted accordingly.



I wanted to experiment with a more intricate class structure and some complex recursion.
A few pretty advanced mathematical concepts are also employed.
Especially, while creating the texture for my sprites.
